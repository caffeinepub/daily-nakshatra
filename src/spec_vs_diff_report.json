There is no clear evidence in the provided diff summary of the actual production Internet Computer deployment work required by REQ-2 (e.g., deployment config/scripts, canister settings, or release steps), nor evidence that the backend upgrade/init path was specifically handled for a live upgrade.",

      "requirement": "Deploy Version 22 to the live Internet Computer canister(s) so end users receive this release when loading the production URL.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code/config edits (notably frontend version constant and HTML cache headers), but no explicit deployment-related changes (e.g., dfx deploy configuration, canister IDs, CI/CD pipeline updates, or release scripts) that would demonstrate production canister deployment and upgrade behavior.",
