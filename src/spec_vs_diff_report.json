  "summary": "The diff shows a change in TodayPage.tsx to set the hero background image using a BASE_URL-prefixed path with the filename quoted (to handle spaces/parentheses). However, the diff does not show the new image asset being added to the repository/static assets, and the truncated TodayPage diff does not provide clear evidence that the hero overlay text was moved to the bottom lower third and remains responsive/readable.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the new hero background image asset \"Untitled design (33).png\" is present in the correct frontend static assets location so it reliably loads in dev and production (no 404).",
      "reason": "The code references the asset path, but the diff shows no added files and no evidence the PNG was placed under the expected static assets directory. Without the asset addition/move, the request can still 404 in dev/prod.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Added files = none",
        "frontend/src/pages/TodayPage.tsx (references `assets/Untitled design (33).png`)"
      ]

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Reposition the hero overlay text (glyph, heading, subtitle) to the bottom lower third of the hero image area with responsive padding and readability (overlay/scrim).",
      "reason": "TodayPage.tsx is truncated after the backgroundImage style; the provided snippet does not include the overlay text container/layout classes, so the lower-third positioning and responsive readability cannot be verified from the diff evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/TodayPage.tsx (truncated before overlay text layout is shown)"

    {
      "description": "Updating/adding narrative claims in frontend-file-summaries.txt about multiple pages/components and typography/behavior changes beyond the requested Today hero changes.",
      "reason": "Non-goals explicitly say not to redesign other sections beyond the hero image loading and hero text positioning; the summary text claims broader changes (e.g., typography throughout, multiple pages/components). Even if only documentation, it introduces unrequested scope in the recorded summaries.",
