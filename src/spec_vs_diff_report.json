  "summary": "Implemented a “Use Current Position” geolocation flow in the City Picker, added support for persisting/restoring geolocation-derived locations (with timezone validation and safe fallback), and ensured Nakshatra/React Query recomputes/refetches when switching to current position by incorporating a selection refresh key into hooks/query keys.",

      "description": "Expanded/overwrote the predefined city list to a larger set of 25 cities with coordinates.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on fixing current-position geolocation/timezone persistence/refresh behavior and explicitly lists as a non-goal “Adding a full world-city database”. While this is not necessarily a full database, modifying the predefined list to many global cities was not requested as part of REQ-20/21/22.",
